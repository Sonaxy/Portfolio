This is true for both brick-and-mortar outlets and online stores. The website traffic data acquired from an online retailer and provides information on customer’s website site visit behavior. Customers may visit the store multiple times, on multiple days, with or without making a purchase.\nThe goal is to predict how much sales revenue can be expected from each customer. The variable revenue lists the amount of money that a customer spends on a given visit…… Check out the GitHub Repository"

Readmission rates have increasingly been used as an outcome measure in health services research and as a quality benchmark for health systems. Hospital readmission rates were formally included in reimbursement decisions for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, which penalizes health systems with higher than expected readmission rates through the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program.\nThe real-world clinical care data used in this project comes from multiple hospitals across the United States for several years…… Check out the GitHub Repository"

Most consumers may expect a few conditions to affect the time to deliver, but there may be many circumstances that impact the delivery time. For example, if the algorithm knows that there is a crash impeding traffic between the major routes of the customer and the delivery service, then that may impact the transport time. Overall, providing accurate estimates to the customer will help manage expectations, which may lead to retained customers.\nThis detailed analysis aims to predict estimated delivery times for a food delivery service…… Check out the GitHub Repository"

These gas prices can be very unpredictable and experience significant change frequently. Understanding the variables that affect these prices and the autocorrelation in the data can improve understanding of future prices in the market and enable forecasting of gasoline prices.\nThe primary task for this project is developing a forecasting model for future Brazilian gas prices. Several benchmarks models are implemented…… Check out the GitHub Repository"
